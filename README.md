# Tea Leaf Disease Detection

## Overview

Tea Leaf Disease Detection is a deep learning project aimed at identifying various diseases affecting tea leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project leverages image classification techniques to distinguish between healthy and diseased leaves.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of tea leaves categorized based on different diseases. The dataset can be accessed and downloaded from Kaggle:

[Identifying Disease in Tea Leafs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashwatwork/identifying-disease-in-tea-leafs/code)

## Features

- **Input:** Images of tea leaves (Healthy/Diseased)
- **Output:** Predicted category of the tea leaf
- **Model Used:** CNN-based deep learning model

## How to Use

1. Download the dataset and preprocess the images.
2. Train the CNN model using the training dataset.
3. Evaluate the model’s performance using validation and test datasets.
4. Use the trained model to classify new tea leaf images.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
